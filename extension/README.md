# Pokémon Showdown Randbats Tooltip

Enhanced tooltip functionality for Pokémon Showdown Random Battle formats. This extension relies on
data from https://pkmn.github.io/randbats/ which is an automatically updating repository of the
latest options for Pokémon Showdown's standard Random Battle formats and is the same source that
provides data to [Pokémon Showdown's Random Battle Damage
Calculator](https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/randoms.html?mode=randoms). More precise information
about a Pokémon's possible abilities, items, moves, and stats are presented in addition to the
standard tooltip information provided by Pokémon Showdown.

## Install

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/)

## Caveats

Due to Pokémon Showdown's release process, the **information in the tooltip can be stale for up to
an hour if changes to the Random Battle team generation logic are hotpatched immediately after being
committed**. This should rarely be consequential in practice, though may explain any discrepancies that
may crop up.
